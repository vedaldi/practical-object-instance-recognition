function matches = matchWords(a, b)
% MATCHWORDS Matches sets of visual words
%   MATCHES = MATCHWORDS(A, B) finds occurences in B of each element
%   of A. Each matched pair is stored as a row of the 2xN matrix MATCHES,
%   such that A(MATCHES(1,i)) == B(MATCHES(2,i)).
%
%   By default, if an element of A matches to more than one element of
%   B, only one of the possible matches is generated.
